# Section 03 - Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

## Introduction to MCP (Model Context Protocol)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open-source standard designed to connect AI applications to external systems. With MCP, AI applications like Claude or ChatGPT can link to data sources (e.g., local files, databases), tools (e.g., search engines, calculators), and workflows (e.g., specialized prompts), enabling them to access essential information and perform tasks.

Think of MCP as a **USB-C port for AI applications**. Just as USB-C provides a universal way to connect electronic devices, MCP offers a standardized method for connecting AI applications to external systems.

### What Can MCP Enable?

MCP unlocks powerful capabilities for AI applications:

- **Personalized AI Assistants**: Agents can access your Google Calendar and Notion, acting as a more tailored AI assistant.
- **Advanced Code Generation**: Claude Code can create a complete web app using a Figma design.
- **Enterprise Data Integration**: Enterprise chatbots can connect to multiple databases within an organization, allowing users to analyze data through chat.
- **Creative Workflows**: AI models can design 3D objects in Blender and print them using a 3D printer.
- **Real-time Information Access**: Connect to external data sources for up-to-date information.
- **Complex Multi-step Operations**: Execute sophisticated workflows by combining multiple tools and systems.

### Why Does MCP Matter?

MCP offers benefits across the ecosystem:

**For Developers**: MCP simplifies and speeds up development when building or integrating AI applications or agents.

**For AI Applications**: MCP provides access to a wide range of data sources, tools, and apps, enhancing capabilities and improving user experience.

**For End-users**: MCP enables more capable AI applications or agents that can access your data and take actions on your behalf when needed.

## Small Language Models (SLMs) in MCP

Small Language Models represent an efficient approach to deploying AI, offering several advantages:

### Benefits of SLMs
- **Resource Efficiency**: Lower computational requirements.
- **Faster Response Times**: Reduced latency for real-time applications.  
- **Cost Effectiveness**: Minimal infrastructure needs.
- **Privacy**: Can operate locally without transmitting data.
- **Customization**: Easier to fine-tune for specific domains.

### Why SLMs Work Well with MCP

SLMs combined with MCP create a powerful synergy where the model's reasoning capabilities are enhanced by external tools, compensating for their smaller parameter count with added functionality.

## Python MCP SDK Overview

The Python MCP SDK provides the foundation for developing MCP-enabled applications. The SDK includes:

- **Client Libraries**: For connecting to MCP servers.
- **Server Framework**: For building custom MCP servers.
- **Protocol Handlers**: For managing communication.
- **Tool Integration**: For executing external functions.

## Practical Implementation: Phi-4 MCP Client

Let’s examine a real-world implementation using Microsoft’s Phi-4 mini model integrated with MCP capabilities.

### MCP Architecture Overview

MCP uses a **client-server architecture** where an MCP host (an AI application like Claude Code or Claude Desktop) establishes connections to one or more MCP servers. The MCP host achieves this by creating one MCP client for each MCP server.

#### Key Participants

- **MCP Host**: The AI application that coordinates and manages one or more MCP clients.
- **MCP Client**: A component that maintains a connection to an MCP server and retrieves context from the server for the MCP host to use.
- **MCP Server**: A program that provides context to MCP clients.

#### Two-Layer Architecture

MCP consists of two distinct layers:

**Data Layer**: Defines the JSON-RPC-based protocol for client-server communication, including:
- Lifecycle management (connection initialization, capability negotiation).
- Core primitives (tools, resources, prompts).
- Client features (sampling, elicitation, logging).
- Utility features (notifications, progress tracking).

**Transport Layer**: Defines the communication mechanisms and channels:
- **STDIO Transport**: Uses standard input/output streams for local processes (optimal performance, no network overhead).
- **Streamable HTTP Transport**: Uses HTTP POST with optional Server-Sent Events for remote servers (supports standard HTTP authentication).

### MCP Core Primitives

MCP defines primitives that specify the types of contextual information that can be shared with AI applications and the range of actions that can be performed.

#### Server Primitives

MCP defines three core primitives that servers can expose:

**Tools**: Executable functions that AI applications can invoke to perform actions.
- Examples: file operations, API calls, database queries.
- Methods: `tools/list`, `tools/call`.
- Support dynamic discovery and execution.

**Resources**: Data sources that provide contextual information to AI applications.
- Examples: file contents, database records, API responses.
- Methods: `resources/list`, `resources/read`.
- Enable access to structured data.

**Prompts**: Reusable templates that help structure interactions with language models.
- Examples: system prompts, few-shot examples.
- Methods: `prompts/list`, `prompts/get`.
- Standardize AI interaction patterns.

#### Client Primitives

MCP also defines primitives that clients can expose to enable richer interactions:

**Sampling**: Allows servers to request language model completions from the client’s AI application.
- Method: `sampling/complete`.
- Enables model-independent server development.
- Provides access to the host’s language model.

**Elicitation**: Allows servers to request additional information from users.
- Method: `elicitation/request`.
- Enables user interaction and confirmation.
- Supports dynamic information gathering.

**Logging**: Enables servers to send log messages to clients.
- Used for debugging and monitoring purposes.
- Provides visibility into server operations.

### MCP Protocol Lifecycle

#### Initialization and Capability Negotiation

MCP is a stateful protocol that requires lifecycle management. The initialization process serves several critical purposes:

1. **Protocol Version Negotiation**: Ensures both client and server use compatible protocol versions (e.g., "2025-06-18").
2. **Capability Discovery**: Each party declares supported features and primitives.
3. **Identity Exchange**: Provides identification and versioning information.

```python
# Example initialization request
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "initialize",
  "params": {
    "protocolVersion": "2025-06-18",
    "capabilities": {
      "elicitation": {},  # Client supports user interaction
      "sampling": {}      # Client can provide LLM completions
    },
    "clientInfo": {
      "name": "edge-ai-client",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Tool Discovery and Execution

After initialization, clients can discover and execute tools:

```python
# Discover available tools
tools_response = await session.list_tools()

# Execute a tool
result = await session.call_tool(
    "weather_current",
    {
        "location": "San Francisco",
        "units": "imperial"
    }
)
```

#### Real-time Notifications

MCP supports real-time notifications for dynamic updates:

```python
# Server sends notification when tools change
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "notifications/tools/list_changed"
}

# Client responds by refreshing tool list
await session.list_tools()  # Get updated tools
```

## Getting Started: Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Environment Setup

Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install fastmcp mcp-python-client openai requests pyautogui Pillow
```

### Step 2: Basic Configuration

Set up your environment variables:
```python
# System Configuration
SYSTEM_PROMPT = "You are an AI assistant with some tools."

# Ollama Configuration (Local)
OLLAMA_URL = "http://localhost:11434/api/chat"
OLLAMA_MODEL_ID = "phi4-mini:3.8b-fp16"

# vLLM Configuration (Server)
VLLM_URL = "http://localhost:8000/v1"
VLLM_MODEL_ID = "microsoft/Phi-4-mini-instruct"
```

### Step 3: Running Your First MCP Client

**Basic Ollama Setup:**
```bash
python ghmodel_mcp_demo.py
```

**Using vLLM Backend:**
```bash
python ghmodel_mcp_demo.py --env vllm
```

```bash
python ghmodel_mcp_demo.py --run sse
```

**Custom MCP Server:**
```bash
python ghmodel_mcp_demo.py --server /path/to/server.py
```

### Step 4: Programmatic Usage

```python
import asyncio
from ghmodel_mcp_demo import OllamaClient, Phi4MiniMCPClient

async def automated_interaction():
    # Configure MCP server parameters
    server_params = StdioServerParameters(
        command="npx",
        args=["@playwright/mcp@latest"],
        env=None,
    )
    
    # Create MCP client and process tools
    async with Phi4MiniMCPClient(server_params) as mcp_client:
        tools = await process_mcp_tools(mcp_client)
        llm_client = OllamaClient()
        
        # Generate response with tool capabilities
        response, messages = await llm_client.generate_response(
            "Help me automate a web task",
            tools
        )
        return response

# Execute the automation
result = asyncio.run(automated_interaction())
print(result)
```
